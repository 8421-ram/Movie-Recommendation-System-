# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Overview  
This **Movie Recommendation System** suggests movies to users based on their preferences using machine learning techniques. The project implements **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** approaches to generate personalized recommendations. The system is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to explore movies and receive tailored suggestions.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Personalized Movie Recommendations** – Get tailored suggestions based on user input.  
✔ **Machine Learning Models** – Implements **content-based filtering** (TF-IDF, cosine similarity) and **collaborative filtering** (KNN, Matrix Factorization).  
✔ **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and intuitive experience.  
✔ **Movie Search** – Search for movies and find similar recommendations.  
✔ **Scalability** – Can handle large datasets with efficient processing techniques.  

## 🏗️ Project Architecture  
The recommendation system follows a structured approach:  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the movie dataset.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text-based similarity and **cosine similarity** for content-based recommendations.  
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizing **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Matrix Factorization** to suggest movies based on user preferences.  
4. **Web Application**: Deploying the model using **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models  
- **Streamlit** – Web application framework  
- **NLTK & TF-IDF** – Text-based recommendation system  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Collaborative filtering algorithm

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation  
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git
cd movie-recommendation
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8+). Then install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Streamlit Application  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the **web app** in your browser.

## 📊 How It Works  
1. The user searches for a movie in the Streamlit app.  
2. The system finds similar movies using **content-based filtering** (TF-IDF, cosine similarity).  
3. If a user history exists, **collaborative filtering** (KNN) suggests movies based on user preferences.  
4. The recommended movies are displayed in the app with details such as title, genre, and poster images.

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Improve recommendation accuracy using **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)**.  
🔹 Implement **Hybrid Recommendation Systems** (combining content-based & collaborative filtering).  
🔹 Add a **User Authentication System** for personalized recommendations.  
🔹 Deploy the app on **AWS/GCP/Azure** for wider accessibility.
